## CareTacker

- CareTracker is a web application used by a parent, guidant,or teacher to track the daily activities of a special needs child. It starts with a home page that asks the user to signup or login (if that person has already used it before). Once the caregiver has signup/login, they're redirected to the general list of all the actvities entered by all users. He/She has the option to either enter a new daily activity or edit ONLY his/her entry. Once the editing (edit or delete) is done, the user is redirected back to the show page of all the daily activities. Upon completion, the user can logout and will be directed back to the home page.
